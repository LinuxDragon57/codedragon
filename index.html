                <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I've always had an affinity for technology, but I was first introduced to computer programming
                    in eighth grade when professors from the University of North Alabama presented to my advanced math
                    class. At first, since I've never felt that I was particularly strong in math, I thought that I'd
                    never be smart enough for the mathematical gymnastics required for programming. However, I was
                    nominated for UNA's STEM camp in 2016 by my high school's math department, where I discovered 
                    that I actually quite enjoyed creating algorithms. Afterwards, my hunger for
                    more knowledge led me down a long and winding journey of discovery and adventure within tech.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My adventure began with a Raspberry Pi, and with it came my first discovery: Linux. Ever since,
                    I've been an active Linux user and FOSS community activist. My knowledge of the world's most popular
                    OS has only grown exponentially, and now I run it on everything from my multiple hobbyist SBCs to
                    my self-built gaming computer to my Linode VPS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Robots are really rad. But do you know what's even better? Space Robots... Astronomy has captivated
                    my attention since I was a 4-year-old. All my life I've dreamed of being an astronaut or an
                    astronomer, but when I discovered how awesome robots were; I became dubious between pursuing a
                    career in astronomy versus Computer Science. Yet, when the Perseverance Rover landed on Mars;
                    a revelation occurred to me: why not help engineer space robots and their space robot AI?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another computer science topic that captivates me is cryptography. I've been working hard to
                    learn about implementing these systems in an effort to learn more about them. While technically
                    overkill for this domain; I've implemented SSL encryption with at least a TLS 1.2 Handshake, HSTS,
                    Secure Renegotiation, SSL Stapling, DNS CAA, and even DNSSEC. Furthermore, my website also receives
                    an A+ rating for its <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=codedragon.dev&followRedirects=on"
                                            target="_blank">Security Headers</a> and an A+ rating for its SSL security on
                    <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=codedragon.dev" target="_blank">
                    SSL Labs</a>. Honestly, I don't fully understand all of these security measures even if I do know
                    how to implement them; but I'd really like to better understand how cryptography works and its
                    algorithmic implementations.

                    My first hobby was reading. In my early days, I'd read any children's books about space, but finally
                    my third grade teacher pushed me to read something different. That was when I fell in love with
                    fiction books. I still remember the first series I ever read: <em>Deltora Quest</em> by Emily Rhodda.
                    Many of my favorite fictional stories are filled with all sorts of fantastic creatures of myths, and
                    dragons are among my favorite - though the dragons of books are more interesting and diverse than
                    the dragons of the movies.

                    Over the years, the countless voices of all the authors whose works I've read have nurtured another
                    hobby of mine: writing. Combined with the guidance of my English teachers, I've been able to also
                    grow and become a better writer. My first real programming project is a blog CMS for my
                    personal blog at <a href="https://www.linuxdragon.dev">https://www.linuxdragon.dev</a>.
